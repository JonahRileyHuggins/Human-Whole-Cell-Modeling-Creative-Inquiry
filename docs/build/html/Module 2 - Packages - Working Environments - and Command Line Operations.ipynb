    "Python packages are a extensions to the base python language that simplify functionality for users. Imagine if you will; trying to write a large Machine Learning application using only basic the python syntax in the last module; it's pretty difficult. In brief, a Python package is a collection of Python modules (files with `.py` extension) organized in directories that provide reusable code for various tasks. Packages make it easy to include external libraries in your projects.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.1 What Is a Working Environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "A working environment is an isolated environment where you can install specific versions of Python and Python packages. This isolation ensures that your projects do not interfere with each other, even if they require different versions of a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Why Use Working Environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using working environments helps avoid dependency conflicts and ensures reproducibility of your projects. For example, you can have one environment with Python 3.8 and another with Python 3.10, each with its own set of installed packages.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Introduction to Command Line Usage\n",
    "Running Python scripts from the command line is a fundamental skill that allows you to execute your code without the need for an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or a notebook interface like Jupyter. This is particularly useful for automation, batch processing, or running long scripts on remote servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Creating a Python Script\n",
    "First, let's create a simple Python script. You can create a Python file (`.py` extension) using any text editor (e.g., Notepad, VSCode, Sublime Text) or directly from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a simple Python script\n",
    "script_content = \"\"\"\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    if len(sys.argv) > 1:\n",
    "        name = sys.argv[1]\n",
    "        print(greet(name))\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Usage: python script_name.py [your_name]\")\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Writing the script to a file\n",
    "with open(\"greet.py\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(script_content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This script defines a simple function `greet` that takes a name as an argument and prints a greeting. It also uses the `sys.argv` list to access command-line arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Running the Script from the Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this script from the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).\n",
    "2. Navigate to the directory where your script is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# On Windows\n",
    "cd path\\to\\your\\script\n",
    "\n",
    "# On macOS/Linux\n",
    "cd /path/to/your/script\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Basic usage\n",
    "python greet.py Alice\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4 Command-Line Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, `Alice` is passed as a command-line argument to the script. The script checks if an argument is provided and prints a greeting. If no argument is provided, it prints a usage message.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "# Running the script with no arguments\n",
    "python greet.py\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Usage: python script_name.py [your_name]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.5 Making a Script Executable (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "On Unix-based systems (macOS/Linux), you can make your Python script executable and run it directly without specifying `python` before the script name.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add a shebang line at the beginning of the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make the script executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "chmod +x greet.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run the script directly.\n",
    "\n",

    "./greet.py Alice\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.6 Redirecting Output and Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "You can redirect the output or errors from your script to a file using `>` for output or `2>` for errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Redirecting output to a file\n",
    "python greet.py Alice > output.txt\n",

    "# Redirecting errors to a file\n",
    "python greet.py > output.txt 2> errors.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.7 Automating Script Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "To automate the execution of Python scripts, especially on servers, you can use tools like `cron` on Unix-based systems or Task Scheduler on Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Running a Script Every Day at Midnight (Unix-based systems)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the crontab file for editing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "crontab -e\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add a cron job to run your script every day at midnight.\n",

    "### 5.8 Best Practices for Command Line Scripts\n",
    "- **Use meaningful names** for your scripts and command-line arguments.\n",
    "- **Provide usage information** and **error messages** to guide users.\n",
